# Cordova Progress-Indicator Plugin#
This plugin allows you to show a native Progress Indicator on iOS. This is a fork of the `org.pbernasconi.progressindicator` plugin by [Paolo Bernasconi](https://github.com/pbernasconi). The original plugin is available at: [https://github.com/pbernasconi/cordova-progressIndicator](https://github.com/pbernasconi/cordova-progressIndicator).

#### Changes in this fork
 This fork was created to fix th following issues:
 
 1. Native iOS crash on multiple calls to `hide()`.
 2. Unable to clone the repository on Windows due to the paths being too long in the demos directory.
 
 I've also changed the plugin ID to `net.justin-credible.cordova-progress-indicator` help avoid confusion.
